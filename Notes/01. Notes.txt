In GraphQL, there is only one end-point, for our case, we named it as /graphql

		Query VS Mutations

When we want to get some data from the server, it's a QUERY

Ex. Get user by ID
Ex. Get feed items for a user
Ex. Get user profile information

When you want to send some data to the server, it's a Mutation

Ex. CREATE a new user
Ex. CREATE a new post

		typeDefs

Inside your GraphQL, typeDefs is basically your schema

Schema: What types of QUERIES, MUTATIONS, you are going to use

		resolvers

And based on the Schema, you are have to define your RESOLVERS

In resolvers, you actually make functions that are going to resolve that particular data
